VideoReducer watches folders for new video files and re-compresses them if they are larger than a set size. 

It uses FFMPEG with customizeable compression settings to compress files.

Drag-and-drop folders to watch them for new video files.

VideoReducer is built with Node-webkit, which is a fusion of NodeJS and the Chromium web browser.

The interface is HTML/Javascript with AngularJS, jQuery, Bootstrap, and other common libraries. 

NodeJS runs the FFMPEG processes as well as watching folders and dealing with local filesystem access.
